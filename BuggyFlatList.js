This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that when scrolling quickly, the component may fail to render items correctly, leading to blank spaces or incorrect item display. This is often due to performance issues caused by inefficient rendering or data processing within the FlatList's renderItem function.  The problem is exacerbated when items are complex or require heavy computations.
